Today I was a bit bored, so I decided to decompile my favourite racing game, **Barro**.
It was surprisingly easy and I didn't go through as much effort as I thought I would,
however not everything is COMPLETELY accurate, do mind that.

## Files not included
I have decided not to include any audio/image/level assets
as they could POSSIBLY result in me getting a DMCA,
however I've left the meta files so you know what you're meant to add by yourself.
I recommend using **uTinyRipper** to extract the files needed to make the game run.
You'll need a legitimate copy of the game from Steam, on its version `V.2021.1.0`.
Anything later or earlier than that and it might not work, I haven't tried for myself.
Good luck extracting! *It'll be as fun as it was for me.*
