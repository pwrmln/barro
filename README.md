Today I was a bit bored, so I decided to decompile my favourite racing game, **Barro**.<br>
It was surprisingly easy and I didn't go through as much effort as I thought I would,<br>
however not everything is COMPLETELY accurate, do mind that.

## Files not included
I have decided to only include the Assets folder, and within that I've excluded the
images/sounds/levels as everything else could POSSIBLY result in me getting a DMCA,<br>
however I've left the meta files so you know what you're meant to add by yourself.<br>
I recommend using **uTinyRipper** to extract the files needed to make the game run.<br>
You'll need a legitimate copy of the game from Steam, on its version `V.2021.1.0`.<br>
Anything later or earlier than that and it might not work, I haven't tried for myself.<br>
Good luck extracting! *It'll be as fun as it was for me.*


```Have fun ruining the best game ever.```<br>
